Github collaboration workflow demo
==================================

## Initial Steps:

1. Fork the repo on github
2. Clone to your machine
3. Work against master
4. Commit code to master
5. Push master to origin
6. Issue a pull request against upstream master

Most of the time merges will be resolved automatically via a fast forward.

### Resolving conflicts

Sometimes, there will be conflicts. Conflicts occur when two people change the same lines of a file.

* One person is in charge of conflict resolution
  * That person goes to the person issuing the pull request to do the merge
